/// graphics stack, so the app tells it through the guest agent and the VM's
/// omacvm-desktop-recover acts:
/// - Hyprland lost: it draws black from then on. The desktop session starts
///   again by itself; apps open in the VM close and their unsaved work is
///   lost (the new session names them). At most once in `window`: when it
///   is lost again that soon, the app asks instead (a cause that stays, such
///   as macOS short of memory, would only repeat it).
/// - The shell lost (Omarchy's bar and launcher, Quickshell): only the shell
///   starts again, no app closes. At most once a minute.
/// Off: the app asks every time, as up to 3.0.0.
/// Hidden: defaults write org.omacvm.app desktopAutoRestart -bool false
///
