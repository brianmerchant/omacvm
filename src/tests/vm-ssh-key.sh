# VM copied to another Mac is still reached there: on 2026-10-09 a VM copied
# from a MacBook Pro to a MacBook Air trusted only the MacBook Pro's
# ~/.ssh/omacvm, and Update VM waited for SSH. app_ssh_key makes it, vm_pin
# finds it, gssh (the omacvm command) and vssh (the app's scripts) offer it
# before the Mac's key. A stand-in ssh prints what it gets; fixture home only.
