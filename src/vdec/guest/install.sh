#!/bin/bash
# Chromium's video decoding on the Mac's media engine (OmacVM.app). Run as root
# inside the VM: ./install.sh <desktop-user> on|off
#   on:  the omacvm-vdec kernel module (a V4L2 video decoder) through DKMS,
#        rebuilt by pacman's DKMS hook for every new kernel with its headers;
#        omacvm-vdecd, which decodes for it with VA-API (the app's VideoToolbox
#        backend); Chromium's switch for its V4L2 decoder in the user's flags,
#        and an extension that has YouTube send VP9 instead of AV1 (this
#        Chromium decodes AV1 only on the CPU)
#        A pacman hook builds the daemon again when FFmpeg's soname changes
#        and starts it when it was down (vdecd.sh). A WirePlumber rule
#        keeps the sound from hanging on the decoder (50-omacvm-vdec.conf).
#   off: all of it goes again (dkms and the kernel headers stay installed)
# Arch Linux ARM's Chromium has no VA-API, only V4L2: see docs/adr/0025.
# Google Chrome and Brave use VA-API directly and need none of this.
#   An update while an app has the decoder open: the new module loads at the
#   next VM start (omacvm check says so); the running daemon is restarted
#   only when it or the module changed.
