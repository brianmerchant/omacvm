#                                        what an install would trust (no root):
#                                        "team TEAM" or "exact build", and why;
#                                        then where the daemon would come from:
#                                        "daemon: app", "daemon: source" or
#                                        "daemon: refused"
# The daemon comes built and signed inside OmacVM.app (Contents/Library/
# LaunchServices, Developer ID for published apps): no Xcode needed. It is
# used only when OmacVM's release key vouches for the app's team (below) or
# this script is the app's own copy. Else (another app, nobody vouches for
# it), and for apps without one: built here from this source (needs Xcode's
# Command Line Tools); without them the install is refused: an app nobody
# vouches for never gets its own file run as root.
# Accepted callers: processes of the Mac users who installed it (each user who
# runs this is added) that are QEMU signed with the Developer ID team of the
# app's own QEMU (the app the person installs it for; a later app of another
# team asks again), when OmacVM's release key vouches for that team: the
# signed update feed of the app's release lists it (src/release/keys.py, main
# or spare key), or this script is the app's own copy (its Fast Network
# button: the app vouches for itself). Else (an app signed ad hoc, built from
# source, or a Developer ID no feed lists): exactly that app's QEMU (its
# cdhash: install again after rebuilding the app).
# OMACVM_ADMIN_PROMPT=gui: macOS's own password dialog instead of sudo in a
# terminal (OmacVM.app's Fast Network button and the control centre's jobs
# run this script that way); no dialog when sudo needs no password.
# OMACVM_NETD_TEST_ROOT (--status only, for tests): the daemon's files under
# that folder instead of /.
# Exit codes: 0 done, 1 failed, 2 usage, 3 needs a person (no password to ask
# for), 4 the person cancelled the password dialog.
