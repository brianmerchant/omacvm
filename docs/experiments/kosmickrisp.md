# Venus on KosmicKrisp (macOS 26 and newer)

Round 1 of the kosmickrisp track, 2026-10-04, on a Mac mini M4 (10 cores, 16 GB,
macOS 27.0) with an LG UltraFine 5K. The test VM ran in OmacVM.app's runtime with
6 CPUs and 8 GB, the Mac mini's screen locked.

KosmicKrisp is Mesa's Vulkan driver on Metal 4. It replaces MoltenVK under Venus on
macOS 26 and newer: the runtime carries both and libvirglrenderer picks KosmicKrisp
there, MoltenVK before (and as a fallback).

## What it took

Host (OmacVM.app runtime, `app/runtime`):

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `build-kosmickrisp.sh` | Builds KosmicKrisp from Mesa `e5f0687867f5` (sha256-pinned archive). First Mesa's OpenCL-C compiler `mesa_clc` with Homebrew LLVM, then the driver with `-Dmesa-clc=system -Dllvm=disabled -Dspirv-tools=disabled -Dzstd=disabled`: the dylib links only system libraries. About 3 minutes on the M4. |
| `-Dplatforms=macos` | Without Mesa's macos platform `VK_USE_PLATFORM_METAL_EXT` is undefined: KosmicKrisp lists `VK_EXT_external_memory_metal` but returns NULL for `vkGetMemoryMetalHandleEXT`. Venus called it and QEMU crashed on the guest's first allocation. |
| `virgl-darwin-venus-metal-entrypoints.patch` | Venus checks both Metal entry points before calling them: a driver without them fails the allocation with a log line, the VM keeps running (it was a guest-triggered host crash). |
| `virgl-darwin-kosmickrisp-fallback.patch` | Before choosing KosmicKrisp, make a throwaway instance with it; when it does not load or has no device, log and use MoltenVK. Both cases tested in the VM: a dylib that is not a Mach-O file ("does not load") and [nodev-icd.c](kosmickrisp/nodev-icd.c), a driver that loads and makes an instance but has no device ("has no device"). Each time QEMU logs the fallback and the guest's `vulkaninfo` shows MoltenVK's feature set. `omacvm check` shows which driver an app VM uses (a fallback is a WARN). |
| `prepare-qemu-gpu-runtime.sh`, `verify-macos-compatibility.sh` | `lib/libvulkan_kosmickrisp.dylib` + `share/vulkan/icd.d/kosmickrisp_mesa_icd.json` next to MoltenVK. The dylib is the one image allowed a macOS 26 minimum: only the Vulkan loader opens it, and only on 26+. |

KosmicKrisp is opt-in at build time: `OMACVM_RUNTIME_KOSMICKRISP=1` adds it, and the runtime
build first runs `build-kosmickrisp.sh --check`, which lists every missing build tool
(Homebrew LLVM, SPIRV-LLVM-Translator, SPIRV-Tools, bison, the macOS 26 SDK) and stops before
QEMU is built. Without the variable the runtime has MoltenVK only; the MacBook builds that way.
The build writes `LICENSE.mesa-kosmickrisp.txt`: it reads ninja's inputs and header deps for the
dylib (871 Mesa files at this commit), sorts them by licence (MIT 855, BSD notices for xxHash and
Berkeley SoftFloat, BSL-1.0 for the C11 threads code, BLAKE3 under Apache-2.0, Khronos
Apache-2.0 and SGI-B-2.0 headers) and writes the licence texts with the copyright lines of the
files' headers (`Copyright ...`, `(C) ...` and `SPDX-FileCopyrightText:` lines; e-mail addresses
are cut, the holder is kept). An unknown licence stops the build. The runtime carries it in
`share/licenses`, and `build-app.sh` refuses to build an app whose runtime has the dylib but
not the notice.
`OMACVM_VULKAN_DRIVER=moltenvk|kosmickrisp` picks the driver by hand at run time.
QEMU's log says which one runs: `vkr: vulkan driver: .../kosmickrisp_mesa_icd.json`.

Guest: Mesa at the same commit with venus, zink and rusticl (`/opt/mesa-kk`), plus one
Mesa fix: [mesa-venus-incremental-present.patch](kosmickrisp/mesa-venus-incremental-present.patch)
(venus forwarded `VK_KHR_incremental_present` to the host when an app enabled it without a
swapchain; Chrome's ANGLE does, and its device creation failed). Arch Linux ARM's Mesa
26.2.3 cannot run Venus at all (no 16 KiB blob alignment); 26.2.4 can.

## What the VM gets

`vulkaninfo` in the guest: `Virtio-GPU Venus (Apple M4)`, venus, Vulkan 1.4.334.

| Feature | KosmicKrisp | MoltenVK 1.4.2 |
|---|---|---|
| nullDescriptor (Zink needs it) | yes | no |
| robustBufferAccess2 | yes | no |
| logicOp | yes | no |
| provoking vertex (ANGLE ES 3.0 needs it) | yes | no |
| transform feedback (Zink GL 3.0 / ES 3.0) | no | no |
| geometry shaders | no | no |
| float64 | no | no |
| tessellation | yes | yes |

## Numbers

Mac mini M4, macOS 27.0, VM 6 CPUs / 8 GB, the Mac's screen locked, runtime from the
gpu-venus branch (virgl fences polled every 1 ms). Median of 3 unless it says otherwise.
The Mac mini also ran another agent's light builds: load average 0.7 to 2.7, except one
spike to 10-20 (12:59-13:05) that overlaps one glmark2 run of each kind. No benchmark
lock exists on the mini; it held only this VM. So none of these numbers had the benchmark lock
of the standards (section 10): read them as a first look, not as a measurement to quote.
All numbers: [results.json](kosmickrisp/results.json).

| Test | KosmicKrisp | MoltenVK 1.4.2 (same Mac) | virgl (OpenGL) |
|---|---|---|---|
| vkmark, headless, 800x600 | **840** (840, 912, 805) | 650 (666, 647, 650) | - |
| vkmark, headless, 1920x1080 | 676 (1 run) | 654 (1 run) | - |
| glmark2-es2 --off-screen, 800x600 | 555 over Zink (560, 555, 429) | Zink does not start | 494 (494, 480, 494), Arch's Mesa 26.2.3 |
| same, both on guest Mesa e5f0687 (round 2) | 558 over Zink (558, 558, 561) | - | **592** (591, 592, 592) |
| Aquarium 30,000 fish, Chrome 154 | **25.9** fps ANGLE on Vulkan (25.9, 25.9, 25.1), see below | ANGLE cannot make ES 3.0 | 21.9 (X11), 22.4 (Wayland) |
| Basemark Web 3.0 | **1620** (1 run; WebGL1 3189, WebGL2 1934) | - | no score after 625 s (the known virgl hang, fixed on gpu-hang) |
| Geekbench 7 GPU OpenCL (rusticl on Zink) | **18886** (19080, 18580, 18886) | no OpenCL device | - |
| clpeak, Vulkan backend, fp32 | **4.01 TFLOPS** | - | - |

vkcube (`--wsi wayland`) runs: 600 frames in 12.4 s with the Mac's screen locked. Its
picture is not checked yet: in this VM `grim` returns a one-colour image even of the plain
desktop, QEMU's screendump of the OpenGL scanout is black, and screen capture over SSH on
the Mac mini showed a stale window. Someone has to look at the window.

Both Vulkan drivers are latency bound at these sizes (about 1.2 ms per frame for any
scene); KosmicKrisp is 29 % faster there at 800x600; the 1080p pair is one run each.
glmark2 over Zink first scored 12 % above virgl, but the two ran on different guest Mesas
(Zink: e5f0687 in `/opt/mesa-kk`; virgl: Arch's 26.2.3). Run again on the same Mesa,
alternating, virgl is 6 % ahead (592 against 558): the gain came from the newer Mesa.

clpeak, Vulkan backend: fp32 4.01 TFLOPS, fp16 4.01, int32 1.01 TOPS, int8 dot 766 GOPS,
global memory 97.5 GB/s, local 1.79 TB/s, image 104 GB/s, host to device 44.5 GB/s,
kernel dispatch 364 us, round trip 1.5 ms. The OpenCL backend through rusticl shows
378 GFLOPS and 48 GB/s only because Zink reports one compute unit and clpeak sizes its
work by it. Whether Geekbench loses anything to it is not known.

Geekbench 7 OpenCL workloads (run 3): Background Blur 10630, Face Tracking 12324, Super
Resolution 12571, Horizon Detection 26728, Photo Filter 27601, Video Filter 26675, RAW
23797, Feature Matching 26541 (0, failed validation, on MoltenVK), Path Tracer 23444,
Particle Physics 13531, Fluid Simulation 16788.

The Mac mini itself, same Geekbench 7.0.0, no VM running: GPU Metal **56025** (56610,
56025, 55883), GPU OpenCL **35240** (35307, 35240, 35169). The VM's OpenCL is 54 % of the
Mac's OpenCL and 34 % of its Metal score. The two were not measured side by side: the VM
ran from 12:31 to 13:29 with the screen locked and other builds on the Mac mini, the Mac's
own runs from 14:37 to 14:48 with no VM running. Geekbench uploads every result to
browser.geekbench.com (public in the free version).

Chrome with ANGLE on Vulkan needs three things today: X11 (`--ozone-platform=x11`;
Chrome refuses Vulkan with Wayland), Venus with the incremental-present fix, and
`--disable-angle-features=supportsPrimitiveTopologyListRestart`. Without the last flag
ANGLE turns on list primitive restart (WebGL 2 keeps restart on), and KosmicKrisp then
unrolls every indexed draw in a compute pass, ending and restarting the Metal render
encoder per draw: Aquarium 1,000 fish ran at 5 fps, 5,000 at 1 fps, 30,000 lost the
device (`VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` on the Mac, Chrome's GPU process aborts). With the flag:
50.9 / 49.7 / 49.9 / 25.3 fps for 100 / 1,000 / 5,000 / 30,000 fish (the ~50 fps cap is
the X11 path with Mesa's software WSI copy, `MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw`).

Stability: the conformance branch's `tests/graphics/soak.sh --vk --minutes 30` (with the
Vulkan load pointed at the guest's Mesa through a `GPUENV` hook): vkmark over Venus on
KosmicKrisp in a loop, Chrome on a WebGL page and mpv playing 1080p60 (both virgl) at the
same time. **Pass**: 1793 s, no missed heartbeat, no stuck fence, 13 vkmark loops with
steady scores (637 to 643, windowed on Wayland), 108,220 WebGL frames, 1.77 million
fences signalled, QEMU's memory 3614 MB at the start and 1672 MB at the end (no growth;
the harness's guest memory field always read 0, so guest memory was not checked). Only
vkmark ran on KosmicKrisp: ANGLE on Vulkan, Zink and rusticl were not soaked.
The Vulkan conformance suite (dEQP-VK) was not run: it is not built in this VM yet.

## Chrome in the VM against Chrome on the Mac (round 2)

Same Mac mini, Chrome 154 on the Mac and in the VM, median of 3, the Mac's screen
unlocked, no other VM running (load average 0.3 to 3.4 from other work on the Mac mini;
it has no benchmark lock, so these numbers are not under the standards' lock either; the
Mac's own runs and the VM's ran at different times). The VM's two paths ran on the same VM:
ANGLE on Vulkan with Venus on KosmicKrisp (this branch's runtime, the flags below, X11),
and virgl on the installed OmacVM.app 2.6.0 runtime (it has the Basemark fix this branch
lacks) with Chrome's defaults on Wayland, as OmacVM ships it.

| | Aquarium, 30,000 fish | Basemark Web 3.0 |
|---|---|---|
| The Mac, Chrome full screen (2560x1322 at 2x) | 60.0 fps (the 60 Hz display); **103.0** without vsync (103.0, 103.2, 98.0) | **1948** (1925, 2013, 1948) |
| The Mac, a 1920x1080 window (1920x993 at 2x) | 60.0; **101.8** without vsync | - |
| VM, ANGLE on Vulkan, Venus on KosmicKrisp | **26.9** (26.8, 26.9, 26.9), 3568x1847 | 1511 (1511, 1558, 1466) |
| VM, virgl (OmacVM.app 2.6.0) | 21.9 (22.1, 21.6, 21.9), 1784x880 at 2x | **1654** (1654, 1793, 1599) |

- Aquarium: KosmicKrisp draws 23 % more frames than virgl, a quarter of the Mac's own
  Chrome without vsync. Both VM canvases have about the same pixels (3568x1847 and
  3568x1760).
- Basemark: virgl reaches 85 % of the Mac, ANGLE on KosmicKrisp 78 %. Take the percentages
  as rough: the two VM paths are not the same setup (other runtimes, this branch against
  2.6.0; X11 with flags and Mesa's software WSI against Wayland with Chrome's defaults), and
  the Mac's full-screen canvas (5120x2644 device pixels) is bigger than the VM's (3568x1847). KosmicKrisp is lower in the WebGL 1 and WebGL 2 parts (3734 and 2225
  against about 5200 and 3000 on virgl). In the draw-call stress its one recorded run (152) is
  inside virgl's range (79 to 177), so no difference can be read from it.
- So for the browser, ANGLE on Vulkan is not a clear win yet: faster with many draws of one
  kind (Aquarium), slower on Basemark's mix, and it needs X11 and flags.
- Basemark uploads each result to powerboard.gpuscore.com.

## Blockers, precisely

- **Zink: OpenGL 2.1 / ES 2.0 only.** KosmicKrisp at this commit has no
  `VK_EXT_transform_feedback` (Zink needs it for GL 3.0 and ES 3.0) and no geometry
  shaders (GL 3.2, ES 3.2). Custom border colours are behind
  `MESA_KK_EXPERIMENTAL=custom_border`. glmark2-es2 runs; anything needing GL 3+ does not.
- **Chrome, ANGLE on Vulkan: works, but only with flags.** See the numbers above for the
  three conditions. Measured with `--ozone-platform=x11 --use-angle=vulkan
  --disable-angle-features=supportsPrimitiveTopologyListRestart
  --disable-native-gpu-memory-buffers --disable-zero-copy` and `MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw`
  for Chrome. Buffers Chrome allocates through GBM come from virgl (Apple OpenGL) and
  cannot be imported into the Venus (Metal) context (`proxy: exported res N to unexpected
  fd_type -1`, then `vkr: failed to import resource`); sharing between the two needs
  IOSurface-backed memory on the Mac. Not a default to ship yet.
- **WebGPU in Chrome: SwiftShader only.** Dawn finds the Venus adapter and marks it
  available, but Chrome only uses an adapter that can import external images. On desktop
  Linux Dawn needs OPAQUE_FD semaphores and exportable images for that; Venus has only
  SYNC_FD semaphores and no exportable optimal-tiling images (checked with
  [extmem.c](kosmickrisp/extmem.c)). Nothing in Chrome's flags changes it.
- **Geekbench GPU Vulkan**: Geekbench 7 for Linux ARM has no Vulkan backend. OpenCL works
  (rusticl), see the numbers.

## Tools

In [kosmickrisp/](kosmickrisp/): `vkprobe.c` (host: which features a driver gives Venus),
`extmem.c` (guest: what Dawn's external-image check sees), `gdpa.c` (host: the NULL
Metal entry point), `nodev-icd.c` (host: a driver without a device, for the fallback test),
`guest-mesa.sh`,
`kk-guest.sh`, `kk-batch.sh` (the measurement round), `results.json` (all numbers).

## For the graphics architecture page and ADR 0013 (gfx-docs branch)

- ADR 0013 status: KosmicKrisp built and tested on macOS 27 (Mac mini M4); bundled
  next to MoltenVK, chosen on macOS 26+, falls back to MoltenVK when it does not load
  or has no device (both tested in the VM).
- Status table: "Venus on KosmicKrisp" built on branch `kosmickrisp`.
- Settings: `OMACVM_VULKAN_DRIVER=moltenvk|kosmickrisp` (run time),
  `OMACVM_RUNTIME_KOSMICKRISP=1` (build time, opt-in). KosmicKrisp's own `MESA_KK_*` variables
  reach it through QEMU's environment.
- Security: the Metal entry points are checked before use (a missing one was a
  guest-triggered host crash). A guest can still drive KosmicKrisp into
  `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST` (Aquarium with list restart on, round 1); whether Venus recovers
  and what it does to the Mac was not tried on purpose, since a host GPU fault can take the
  whole Mac down (the MacBook's 2026-10-04 panic). It belongs with gpu-robust's guest-to-host
  GPU fault work. KosmicKrisp's shader compiler runs inside QEMU, so it adds code the guest
  can reach.
- Build: KosmicKrisp needs Homebrew LLVM, SPIRV-LLVM-Translator, SPIRV-Tools and bison at
  build time only, and the macOS 26 SDK. The runtime build fails in a path with a space
  (meson splits `CFLAGS`), true before this branch too.
