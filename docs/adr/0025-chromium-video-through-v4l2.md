# 0025: Chromium's video through a V4L2 decoder in the VM

Status: accepted, prototype built (`chromium-v4l2`), not merged. Builds on
0014 (VideoToolbox inside virglrenderer's video path), which it uses
unchanged.

## Context

Omarchy's browser is Arch Linux ARM's Chromium. Upstream Chromium builds
VA-API for Linux arm64 by default; Arch Linux ARM turns it off and builds the
V4L2 decoders instead, so the VA-API decoding that Google Chrome, Brave,
Firefox, mpv and FFmpeg use in an OmacVM.app VM never reaches Chromium. It
decodes on the CPU: YouTube 4K60 in VP9 takes about one core in the VM and
1.4 on the Mac. Chromium's V4L2 decoder is also off by default in such builds
(`AcceleratedVideoDecoder`).

What Chromium 153 does with a V4L2 decoder on Linux, read from its source and
seen in the VM:

- It opens `/dev/videoN`, prefers the stateful API, and for a stateful device
  always uses `V4L2StatefulVideoDecoder` (HEVC there is `NOTIMPLEMENTED`).
- The driver allocates the decoded-picture (CAPTURE) buffers; Chromium
  exports them (`EXPBUF`) and its compositor imports the dmabufs with EGL.
- Before the import it checks every plane against the dmabuf's size.
- With GL (as in the VM), the only formats it shows without an image
  processor are ARGB/XRGB; NV12 needs the `AcceleratedVideoDecodeLinuxZeroCopyGL`
  feature.
- AV1 is not compiled in (Chromium ties its AV1 hardware decoding to VA-API).

## Options

1. Chromium's VA-API path with flags, as for Chrome's encoder: not possible,
   it is not in the binary.
2. Build and ship our own Chromium with VA-API: hours of build per release,
   every release, and a package that fights pacman's.
3. Recommend Google Chrome: works today with no flags, but it is not
   Omarchy's browser and has no Arch Linux ARM package.
4. A virtio-media/virtio-video device in QEMU: the guest kernel has no driver
   for it, QEMU has no device, and the decoded pictures would need their own
   way into virgl's GPU buffers. Much new code on the Mac side, where the
   guest is untrusted.
5. A guest V4L2 stateless driver: Chromium parses, and our code translates
   V4L2's per-codec controls into VA-API's picture parameters (H.264, VP9,
   HEVC each).
6. A guest V4L2 stateful driver whose work a daemon does with FFmpeg's VA-API
   decoding.

## Decision

Option 6, everything in the VM, nothing new on the Mac:

- `omacvm-vdec`, a kernel module (DKMS, like the battery module): a V4L2
  stateful decoder that does no decoding. It passes each bitstream buffer to
  `/dev/omacvm-vdec` and takes the answers from there.
- `omacvm-vdecd`, a daemon: FFmpeg decodes with VA-API (Mesa's virgl driver,
  the VideoToolbox backend of 0014), and one GL pass turns each NV12 picture
  into ARGB in the app's CAPTURE buffer.
- The CAPTURE buffers are GBM buffers the daemon makes and hands to the
  module, so what Chromium exports is a virtio-gpu buffer. Buffers the module
  allocated could not be imported: that is why the kernel's own test decoder
  (visl) decodes but shows nothing.
- ARGB because Chromium shows only that with GL, and because one virtio-gpu
  buffer cannot hold both NV12 planes (an import at an offset gets the first
  plane: virgl ignores the offset). VA-API's own surfaces cannot be handed out
  either: in the VM they are one page long, and Chromium's size check fails.
- VA-API's video processing (a shader that the Mac's OpenGL rejects, which
  then poisons the guest's GL context) and `vaCopy` (not implemented) are not
  used; the GL pass replaces both.
- Chromium gets `AcceleratedVideoDecoder` in the last `--enable-features` of
  `~/.config/chromium-flags.conf` (Chromium keeps only the last one).
- YouTube sends AV1 whenever the browser can play it, and this Chromium
  plays AV1 only on the CPU: YouTube at 1080p never reached the decoder. A
  small extension (loaded like Omarchy's own, in the last
  `--load-extension`) tells YouTube that AV1 is not supported, so it sends
  VP9.
- The GPU pass is waited for with an EGL fence after the next decode is
  sent, not right away, so the Mac's GPU does not sit idle between frames.

## Consequences

- Arch Linux ARM's Chromium decodes H.264 and VP9 on the Mac's media engine,
  YouTube included (VP9 up to 4K60). Not covered: HEVC (Chromium's stateful
  decoder lacks it, so it is not offered), AV1 (not in this Chromium; on
  YouTube the extension avoids it, other sites may still send AV1, which
  stays on the CPU), 10-bit (ARGB is 8-bit; VP9 profile 2 stays on the CPU).
- Per frame one extra GPU pass and an ARGB picture (4 bytes a pixel) instead
  of NV12. The CAPTURE buffers are pinned VM memory: about 33 MB each at 4K,
  10 of them for one 4K video.
- A kernel module in the VM, rebuilt by DKMS for every kernel; without the
  headers for a new kernel Chromium falls back to the CPU until they come.
- The daemon parses video from web pages: it runs as its own user, without
  network, in a sandboxed service. One thread serves all videos; at most 8
  decoders are open at once (more fall back to the CPU).
- Failures end in a decode error, never a frozen video: one video that goes
  wrong (a picture under 64 px, a stream VA-API cannot take, the GPU not
  finishing a picture within 1 s) fails alone and Chromium plays it on the
  CPU. If the daemon dies or hangs (systemd's watchdog, 5 s), every open
  video gets a decode error and systemd starts the daemon again 2 s later.
- The module and the daemon trust each other only as far as the protocol
  goes: the module checks every size, index and buffer the daemon hands in,
  never reuses a decoder id, bounds what it queues for the daemon, and a
  daemon of another build is refused (protocol version).
- If Arch Linux ARM builds Chromium with VA-API one day, Chromium uses VA-API
  directly and this can go; nothing here depends on that.
