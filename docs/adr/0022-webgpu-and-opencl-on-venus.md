# 0022: WebGPU and OpenCL on Venus

Status: accepted, built (`webgpu-compute`); for users the feature `vulkan`
(`omacvm enable vulkan`, off by default, OmacVM.app only; `gpu-next`, 3.0.0).
Firefox: WebGPU on by default in Venus VMs. Chromium/Chrome: WebGPU from a
separate launcher. OpenCL: rusticl.
Partly replaces 0013's "rusticl waits for KosmicKrisp". (First written as
0016; renumbered because other branches use 0016-0021.)

## Context

With Venus (0012, 0013) the VM has Vulkan 1.4 on MoltenVK. Two things
people want on top of it: WebGPU in the browser and GPU compute (OpenCL,
e.g. Geekbench GPU, darktable, ffmpeg's OpenCL filters).

What we found (track notes `webgpu-compute`):

- **Firefox 157** runs WebGPU (wgpu) on Venus as soon as
  `dom.webgpu.enabled` is set; it presents through its own copy path.
- **Chrome/Chromium** hands a page a hardware WebGPU adapter on Linux only
  if two gates pass (Chromium `webgpu_decoder_impl.cc`
  `CreatePreferredAdapter`, Dawn `PhysicalDeviceVk.cpp`):
  1. Dawn's backend list holds Vulkan only when Chrome's compositor runs on
     Vulkan (Ganesh-Vulkan or Skia Graphite on Dawn-Vulkan) or "WebGPU on
     Vulkan via GL interop" is on; otherwise it is empty and pages get
     SwiftShader (or nothing).
  2. `SupportsExternalImages()`: `VK_KHR_external_memory_fd` (the host
     already emulates dma-buf export with Metal heaps, so Venus has it) and
     **OPAQUE_FD** semaphores that are exportable and importable. Venus
     offered SYNC_FD only.

  Gate 1 options on MoltenVK: GL interop needs `GL_EXT_semaphore_fd` in
  ANGLE-on-virgl and GL<->Metal memory sharing on the Mac (not there);
  ANGLE on Vulkan gives only ES 2.0 (no `VK_EXT_provoking_vertex`). Skia
  Graphite on Dawn-Vulkan works, but Chrome allows a Vulkan compositor only
  on X11, not Wayland.
- **rusticl** (Mesa's OpenCL) runs on Zink on Venus after Zink changes for
  MoltenVK (push descriptors off, start without `nullDescriptor`).
- MoltenVK 1.4.2 ships a SPIRV-Cross older than two fixes that matter here:
  - it forwards loads through buffer device addresses past stores to the
    same memory (fixed upstream in 090bb6b7, 2026-07-31): every in-place
    swap in OpenCL lost an element, so Geekbench 7's Feature Matching
    failed validation (its bitonic sort);
  - it cannot compile zero-initialized workgroup memory (no
    `gl_WorkGroupSize` declared): WebGPU shaders with workgroup memory lost
    the whole Vulkan context, in Firefox and in Chrome.
  No newer MoltenVK release exists (1.4.2 is from 2026-07-24).
- Arch Linux ARM's Mesa 26.2.3 venus cannot round blob sizes to the
  host's 16 KiB pages; 26.2.4 can.

## Options

1. Wait for KosmicKrisp (macOS 26) for everything.
2. Firefox WebGPU and OpenCL now, built in the guest from pinned Mesa with
   our patches, only on Venus VMs; Chrome stays on SwiftShader.
3. As 2, plus Chrome: OPAQUE_FD semaphores in Venus and Chrome's compositor
   on Graphite/Dawn-Vulkan, from a separate launcher.
4. Chrome by GL interop: host GL<->Metal sharing (IOSurface-backed Venus
   memory, `CGLTexImageIOSurface2D`) plus `GL_EXT_semaphore_fd` in virgl.

## Decision

Option 3. Option 1 leaves macOS 15 users without all of it; option 4 is a
large host project and would still need option 3's semaphores.

`src/app/guest/venus/install.sh` runs from the guest install when the VM
has the feature `vulkan` (`omacvm enable vulkan`; apply also writes the VM
folder's `vulkan` file, from which the app starts that VM with Venus).
Run by hand it acts only when the VM has Venus (three capsets and a
host-visible region in virtio-gpu's debugfs). It builds Mesa 26.2.4 (sha256-pinned) into `/opt/omacvm-mesa`
(venus + zink + rusticl, no GL: virgl keeps serving GL) with:

- `mesa-zink-moltenvk-no-push-descriptors.patch`,
  `mesa-zink-moltenvk-null-descriptor.patch` (Zink on MoltenVK at all);
- `mesa-zink-moltenvk-global-loads.patch`: on MoltenVK Zink reads each
  global address back from a variable, so SPIRV-Cross keeps the load where
  it is (drop with a MoltenVK that has 090bb6b7);
- `mesa-venus-opaque-fd-semaphores.patch`: binary semaphores exportable
  and importable as OPAQUE_FD, backed by the DRM syncobj Venus already
  uses for SYNC_FD (kernel 6.6+);
- `mesa-venus-incremental-present.patch` (from `kosmickrisp`).

It registers the Vulkan and OpenCL ICDs in `/etc`, skips the distro's
venus manifest, sets `RUSTICL_ENABLE=zink`, turns on WebGPU in Firefox and
installs `omacvm-chromium-webgpu` (and `omacvm-chrome-webgpu` for Google
Chrome) with a "Chromium (WebGPU)" menu entry: `--ozone-platform=x11
--enable-skia-graphite --skia-graphite-dawn-backend=vulkan` and
`MESA_VK_WSI_DEBUG=sw` (Venus' software present: 60 fps, DRI3 gives ~30).
`--remove` undoes all of it.

On the host, `virgl-darwin-venus-moltenvk-zero-init.patch` hides
`shaderZeroInitializeWorkgroupMemory` on MoltenVK, also from Vulkan 1.1
guests (Dawn): MoltenVK reports the instance's version as the device's, so
the driver ID is asked for whenever `VK_KHR_driver_properties` is there.

## Consequences

- Firefox and Chromium (launcher) run WebGPU on the Mac's GPU. WebGPU f32
  matmul 2048, one locked batch: Chromium in the VM 5071 GFLOPS, Chrome on
  the Mac 6038 (84 %); Firefox in the VM 665, Firefox on the Mac 319 (SPIR-V
  through MoltenVK's SPIRV-Cross compiles that kernel better than naga's MSL).
- Without `mesa-venus-opaque-fd-semaphores.patch` Chrome in the same mode
  gets no adapter at all; with it, the Venus adapter (tested both ways).
- The launcher costs WebGL about a fifth (Aquarium 14.3 vs 18.4 fps,
  unlocked): WebGL stays on virgl and its frames reach the Vulkan
  compositor by copy. Hence a separate launcher, default Chromium unchanged.
- Copying a WebGPU canvas into a 2D canvas (`drawImage`) gives zeros in
  every Chrome mode in the VM, also the default one: open.
- OpenCL 3.0 device "zink ... (MOLTENVK)"; Geekbench 7 GPU OpenCL passes
  all workloads' validation now: 42486 in the VM vs 95380 for the Mac's own
  OpenCL in one locked batch (before the global-loads patch: 10673, Feature
  Matching failed). Zink reports one compute unit (Vulkan has
  no such query), so tools that size work by CUs (clpeak) under-fill the GPU.
- Each kernel launch crosses the Venus ring: work made of many small
  kernels loses most (locked batch: Face Tracking 27 % and Background Blur
  30 % of the Mac's OpenCL, Particle Physics 37 %, Super Resolution 49 %).
- Unbound descriptors are undefined on MoltenVK instead of zero; rusticl
  binds what kernels use.
- First install builds Mesa in the VM: about 3 minutes on 8 vCPUs (M4 Max),
  pacman included. A stock OmacVM VM has LLVM and Clang (Omarchy installs
  them); the download is about 140 MB: Mesa's source (65 MB), Rust (56 MB)
  and small tools (meson, ninja, bindgen, libclc). The build tools the VM
  lacked are removed after the build, so they take no disk space later.
  Trade-off: a rebuild (an Arch LLVM update, a new Mesa pin) downloads them
  again. Mesa's runtime libraries (Clang, libclc, SPIR-V) stay.
- apply turns Vulkan on (the VM folder's `vulkan` file) only when
  `omacvm_venus_icd.json` is in the VM after the guest step. Without it the
  distro's venus (Mesa 26.2.3, no 16 KiB blob rounding) would get the
  device, and every Vulkan app fails with ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY.
- On macOS 26 KosmicKrisp compiles NIR to MSL itself: the global-loads and
  zero-init workarounds are MoltenVK-only by driver ID. The same guest Mesa
  passes the same checks on KosmicKrisp (Mac mini M4, macOS 27): OpenCL,
  Geekbench 7 with every workload valid, WebGPU in Firefox and Chromium.
- A 36-minute compute soak (OpenCL, WebGPU in both browsers, ffmpeg's
  OpenCL filter) ran 63 rounds without a failure on MoltenVK, and a
  15-minute one 24 rounds on KosmicKrisp (Mac mini). Open: that QEMU's own
  memory levels off over a long compute soak (in the first one QEMU's RSS
  grew about 140 MB a minute, mostly guest RAM being touched, and Metal's
  IOAccelerator memory 1.6 -> 1.8 GB), and a 30-minute soak on KosmicKrisp.
