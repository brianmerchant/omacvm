# Video encoding on the Mac's media engine

In OmacVM.app, apps in the VM that encode H.264 or HEVC through VA-API use the
Mac's media engine instead of the VM's CPU: FFmpeg, screen recording in OBS
Studio, and video calls in Google Chrome (camera and screen sharing).

## What works

| | Status |
|---|---|
| FFmpeg `-c:v h264_vaapi` | yes: Constrained Baseline, Main, High, up to 4096x2304 |
| FFmpeg `-c:v hevc_vaapi` | yes: Main (8-bit), up to 4096x2304 |
| Google Chrome, WebRTC: camera, screen sharing | yes, *VaapiVideoEncodeAccelerator* (H.264) |
| Brave | gets the same switches as Chrome; not tested in a call |
| OBS Studio | yes: *FFmpeg VAAPI H.264* and *HEVC*, screen capture through PipeWire |
| Omarchy's screen recording (gpu-screen-recorder, `h264_vaapi`, constant QP) | yes: 60 frames a second of a 2940x1840 display on a MacBook Air M2, the VM's sound whole (see [While recording](#while-recording)) |
| wf-recorder 0.6 | no: its GPU capture fails on virtio-gpu (Hyprland refuses the buffer) and it crashes; `--no-dmabuf` fails in wf-recorder itself. Software (`-c libx264`) works |
| Firefox | no: Firefox 157 has no VA-API encoder on Linux (it decodes with VA-API only) |
| Chromium from Arch Linux ARM (Omarchy's default browser) | no: built without VA-API (153), so it encodes on the CPU; `omacvm apply` adds the switches once it loads libva |
| HEVC Main 10, VP8, VP9, AV1 | no: the media engine encodes H.264 and HEVC; 10-bit would need P010 pictures |

A real call was tested end to end in a test VM: Chrome with the camera
(OmacVM's *Mac Camera*, `/dev/video42`), the microphone and the whole screen
(xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland) in one WebRTC connection, both video senders on
*VaapiVideoEncodeAccelerator* (`powerEfficientEncoder: true`), audio on Opus.
`chrome://webrtc-internals` shows the same encoder name.

Chrome picks the encoder itself: below 360p it uses its software encoder
(Chrome's rule: "Fallback to SW due to low resolution"), so a call that starts
small switches to the media engine when the resolution goes up. Calls that
negotiate VP8, VP9 or AV1 instead of H.264 stay on the CPU.

### Browser switches

Chrome's VA-API encoder is off on Linux unless `AcceleratedVideoEncoder` and
`VaapiVideoEncoder` are enabled. `omacvm apply` adds them for Chrome and Brave
when the app offers encoding (`src/app/guest/browser-video-encode.py`).
Chrome uses only the last `--enable-features` it is given, and Omarchy's flags
files already have one, so the features are added to the last
`--enable-features` the browser reads (`/etc/chrome-flags.conf`, then
`~/.config/<browser>-flags.conf`), or a new line when there is none. The
user's files are written by a process running as the user. OmacVM remembers
what it added in `/var/lib/omacvm/video-encode-flags.json` (root's) and
removes only that. Omarchy's `omarchy install browser brave` replaces Brave's
file: run `omacvm apply` afterwards. Quit the browser fully once.

Check in the VM: `vainfo` lists `VAEntrypointEncSlice`; `omacvm check` shows
*video encoding* and *WebRTC encoding* (Chrome and Brave when installed,
Chromium once it has VA-API).

## Numbers

Test VM (8 CPUs, 16 GB) on a MacBook Pro M4 Max, bench lock held, other test
VMs paused (2026-10-05). CPU is measured on the Mac: QEMU's CPU time (it
includes the VM's vCPUs) plus the VideoToolbox encoder service
(*VTEncoderXPCService*). The VM's own count is listed for reference only: it
is part of QEMU's time, so adding the two would count it twice, and for the
media engine it is even higher than QEMU's (probably because the VM cannot
tell when its vCPUs wait on the host).

The numbers ran on the encoder as of commit 95ad777, before the last fixes
(failure feedback for refused frames, constant QP, one encode per frame, the
encoder limit). None of them changes how a frame is encoded at a bitrate: a
check run on the later encoder gave the same H.264 result (luma PSNR 39.5748
dB on both).

### FFmpeg

1080p30, 300 frames of a moving test picture with noise (raw NV12 from the
VM's memory), 8 Mbit/s with the same rate limits for all encoders. Median of
5 runs; CPU in seconds for the whole clip:

| Encoder | Frames/s | Mac CPU (QEMU + VT) | VM's count | Luma PSNR | kbit/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `h264_vaapi` (media engine) | 136 | 1.00 s (0.94 + 0.06) | 2.30 s | 39.6 dB | 8013 |
| `libx264 -preset veryfast` | 266 | 6.43 s | 6.11 s | 40.3 dB | 8241 |
| `hevc_vaapi` (media engine) | 84 | 1.23 s (1.15 + 0.08) | 3.38 s | 40.6 dB | 8060 |
| `libx265 -preset ultrafast` | 201 | 10.19 s | 9.73 s | 39.6 dB | 8098 |

- CPU: the media engine needs 16 % of x264's CPU for H.264 (1.00 against
  6.43 s) and 12 % of x265's for HEVC (1.23 against 10.19 s).
- Speed: the media engine is slower in wall time (136 against 266 frames per
  second for H.264, 84 against 201 for HEVC), still far above real time.
  FFmpeg uploads each raw picture to the GPU (`hwupload`), the host copies it
  into the encoder's picture, and each frame waits for its coded data before
  the next one starts. x264 and x265 spread over the VM's CPUs (about 6 and
  7 busy).
- Quality at the same bitrate: H.264 0.7 dB below x264 *veryfast*, HEVC
  1.1 dB above x265 *ultrafast*.

### Chrome WebRTC

30 seconds per run, median of 3. Hardware: the switches above; software:
the same with `--disable-features=AcceleratedVideoEncoder,VaapiVideoEncoder`
(Chrome then uses OpenH264). The test is a loopback in one Chrome
(`tests/video/guest/webrtc-loopback.html`), so the VM also receives, decodes
(VA-API in both cases) and shows every stream. Chrome sends a different
number of frames with each encoder, so the comparison is per frame and per
megapixel sent (`tests/video/webrtc-summary.py`):

| Source | Encoder | Frames/s sent | VM (cores) | QEMU (cores) | Mac CPU per frame | per megapixel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Camera 1280x720 | media engine | 29.9 | 0.49 | 0.78 | 26.4 ms | 28.6 ms |
| | OpenH264 | 27.8 | 0.51 | 0.77 | 27.7 ms | 30.0 ms |
| Screen 1280x720 | media engine | 23.6 | 0.46 | 0.69 | 29.4 ms | 31.9 ms |
| | OpenH264 | 28.1 | 0.56 | 0.79 | 29.1 ms | 31.6 ms |
| Call: camera, microphone, screen | media engine | 50.2 | 0.63 | 1.00 | 20.4 ms | 38.9 ms |
| | OpenH264 | 35.2 | 0.53 | 0.83 | 23.4 ms | 63.8 ms |

Camera and screen alone are `--hd` runs (full size, high starting bandwidth).
In the call Chrome sent the camera at 640x360 in both modes (limited by its
bandwidth estimate) and the screen at 1280x720; the screen sender made about
three times the frames on the media engine (about 20 against 7 per second;
Chrome reported no CPU or bandwidth limit in either case).

What this shows: at 720p the media engine does **not** save the Mac's CPU in
Chrome. Per frame the two are within 5 % for the camera and the screen alone.
The call is 13 % lower per frame on the media engine (20.4 against 23.4 ms)
because its screen sender sent about three times the frames, not because
encoding is cheaper. Most of a call's CPU goes to capturing, Chrome itself and
(in this test) receiving and showing the streams; OpenH264 at 720p is cheap on
an M4 Max. Chrome's own encode time per frame is longer on the media engine
(about 7 ms against 4 ms for the camera: the picture goes through virtio-gpu,
and the frame waits for its data). `webrtc-summary.py` counts each sender's
frames at the last size Chrome reported, so for a call that started smaller
and grew, megapixels are overstated and CPU per megapixel too low; compare
per frame. Not measured yet: 1080p and larger screens, and slower Macs (M1,
M2, MacBook Air), where software encoding costs more.

### Soak

30 minutes on the same runtime, 25 rounds back to back (2026-10-05 01:25 to
01:56). Each round: FFmpeg `h264_vaapi` and `hevc_vaapi` on a 1080p clip (300
frames each, the frame count checked with ffprobe) and a 60-second Chrome call
(camera, microphone, screen). All 50 FFmpeg encodes complete, all 25 calls
send both video streams on *VaapiVideoEncodeAccelerator*, no encoder warning
in QEMU's log, and the same QEMU process the whole time (7.9 GB resident after
the first round, 7.6 GB at the end, 16 GB VM). The soak ran before the last
two encoder fixes (failure feedback for refused frames, constant QP), which
change only those paths.

## How it works

```
App ─VA-API─▶ Mesa's virgl VA driver ─virtio-gpu─▶ virglrenderer (QEMU)
   raw NV12 picture + parameters                   │ VideoToolbox backend
                                                    ▼
   H.264/HEVC access unit (Annex B) ◀── VTCompressionSession (media engine)
```

- The guest's VA-API driver sends one raw NV12 picture per frame (two plane
  textures) and the encode parameters: bitrate, frame rate, key frame interval
  or constant QP, picture type, and its SPS (for the picture's real size).
- Frames are encoded beside QEMU's main loop, which also runs the VM's sound
  and display: the media engine takes 12-40 ms for a Retina-sized frame, and
  the main loop never waits for it. END_FRAME only closes the frame; the
  frame goes to the encoder once the GPU has copied its picture, and its
  coded data and feedback reach the guest's buffers when the encoder is
  done, in order, up to 4 frames in flight per encoder
  (`virgl-videotoolbox-encode-async.patch`). A fence the guest asks for
  after END_FRAME signals only then, so the guest never reads a frame half
  done. Fences are one timeline for the whole VM, so while a frame encodes
  the desktop's own fences wait too (ADR
  [0042](adr/0042-encoder-beside-the-main-loop.md)).
- The host blits the planes into an IOSurface from the compression session's
  pool (a CPU copy if the blit fails) and encodes them in real time without B
  frames. VideoToolbox writes the whole stream; the guest gets an Annex B access
  unit with the parameter sets (SPS and PPS; HEVC also VPS) before each key
  frame. The guest's reference lists and picture order counts are not used:
  VideoToolbox keeps its own (ADR [0024](adr/0024-video-encode-on-videotoolbox.md)).
- Pictures arrive padded (1080p as 1920x1088); the stream gets the size the
  guest's SPS crops them to.
- Rate control: the guest's bitrate as the average, at most 1.5 times it in any
  second. VideoToolbox's low-latency mode is not used for that: it drops
  frames, and VA-API has no way to tell the guest (Chrome then gave up on the
  hardware encoder for screen sharing).
- Constant QP (FFmpeg without `-b:v`, gpu-screen-recorder): the frame QP is
  held between VideoToolbox's `MinAllowedFrameQP` and `MaxAllowedFrameQP`,
  the guest's I- and P-frame QP (the same unless the app sets them apart).
  VideoToolbox takes them only before the first frame, so another QP starts a
  new session, as does a switch between bitrate and constant QP. The sizes
  match the per-frame `BaseFrameQP` of a low-latency session within 1 %, but
  that session's EncodeFrame waits for each frame (12-13 ms at 2940x1840): it
  is used only where the encoder refuses the range, or with
  `OMACVM_VIDEO_ENCODE_BASE_QP=1`. In the test VM, 1080p `-rc_mode CQP`
  (measured with `BaseFrameQP`): QP 18 gives 54 MB (H.264) and 49 MB (HEVC)
  for the 10-second clip, QP 40 2.3 MB and 2.0 MB (luma PSNR 43.0/42.9
  against 36.2/36.3 dB).
- A frame that fails, does not fit the guest's buffer, is refused before it
  reaches the encoder, or is never ended by the guest is reported to the guest
  as failed (never cut short, never the previous frame's result). Only a
  feedback buffer that is missing or not a buffer gets nothing, since there
  is nowhere to write.
- Everything the guest sends is checked on the Mac: sizes (16x16 to
  4096x2304), profiles, frame rate, bitrate, GOP and QP are clamped, the coded
  data and feedback must be buffers. `Tests/virgl/test-video-encode.c` feeds
  nonsense and random picture descriptions (on Apple's software OpenGL).
- 8 encoders at once per VM, 12 at most. Each holds a session on the Mac's
  media engine, which the Mac's own apps (FaceTime, screen recording) and
  other VMs share, and pictures of up to about 14 MB. A call with camera and
  screen sharing uses two. The Mac tells the VM 8 in the encoders' video
  caps, and OmacVM's VA-API shim refuses `vaCreateContext` past that, as for
  the decoders (docs/video-decode.md, Limits): Chrome then encodes in
  software, an FFmpeg command that names a VA-API encoder stops with the
  error. The Mac itself refuses only past 12 (room for closes Mesa sends
  late and apps without the shim); the guest's driver cannot tell that, so
  such an encoder's frames all fail. One encode per frame: a second one in
  the same frame is refused.

Switches on the Mac (QEMU's environment): `OMACVM_VIDEO_NO_ENCODE=1` leaves
encoding out (the guest then encodes on its CPU, and the next `omacvm apply`
takes the browser switches out again), `OMACVM_VIDEO_NO_HEVC=1` HEVC (decoding
and encoding), `OMACVM_VIDEO_DECODE=0` all video. The QEMU log says
`vt-video: hardware H.264 encoding offered` (or *not offered*) at start and
`vt-video: H.264 encoder 1920x1080 (pictures 1920x1088), bitrate` per stream.

Every Apple Silicon Mac (M1 and newer) has hardware H.264 and HEVC encoders;
the backend asks VideoToolbox at run time and offers only what it reports.

## While recording

Omarchy's screen recording (`omarchy-capture-screenrecording --fullscreen`:
gpu-screen-recorder 6.1.3, `h264_vaapi`, constant QP, 60 frames a second)
on a MacBook Air M2, test VM with 4 vCPUs at 2940x1840 60 Hz, 20 s with the
pointer moving and a 30 Hz tone playing (2026-10-08,
`work/tracks/capture-perf.md` in the workspace):

| | 3.0.5 | 3.0.8 |
|---|---|---|
| QEMU's main loop busy | 93 % (78 % waiting in EncodeFrame) | 14 % |
| Main loop late 10 ms or more | 1,082 times, worst 216 ms | 2 times (at the start), worst 55 ms |
| Sound the Mac got | 6.8 s of 20.7 s | 20.7 s of 20.7 s |
| The VM's display | 12 frames a second | 29 frames a second |
| gpu-screen-recorder (VM CPU) | 87 % | 8 % |
| The recording | | 1227 frames in 20.45 s, H.264 2940x1840, plays |

The display stays below 60 while recording: each frame the recorder sends
holds the VM's fences until the media engine is done with it (above). The
start of a recording can still drop 20-40 ms of sound once (the encoder's
session is made and the first picture copied on the main loop).

## Tests

- Build time: `app/runtime/Tests/virgl/test-video-encode.c`, H.264 and HEVC
  through the virgl video protocol: 30 frames decode again with VideoToolbox
  (luma PSNR above 30 dB), parameter sets and IDR in the first access unit,
  nonsense and random picture descriptions, frame-rate changes, a too small,
  a non-buffer and a missing coded-data resource, a frame never ended, two
  encodes in one frame (failure feedback for each), refused sizes and
  profiles, cropped pictures through the GPU blit and the CPU copy, constant
  QP 18 against QP 40 and against 50 kbit/s before and after it, the
  12-encoder limit, three frames sent at once coming back in order after one
  fence, and no fence signalling before the frames ahead of it have their
  feedback. It runs three times: polled fences, QEMU's fences from the sync
  thread (`OMACVM_TEST_THREAD_SYNC=1`) and the low-latency constant QP
  session (`OMACVM_VIDEO_ENCODE_BASE_QP=1`).
- In a VM:
  - `tests/video/ffmpeg-encode.sh [ENCODER...]`: FFmpeg, frames per second,
    the VM's and the Mac's CPU, bitrate, PSNR.
  - `tests/video/webrtc-encode.sh --source camera|screen|call [--hd] [--fake]
    [--features ""]`: Chrome's encoder per video sender, frames, the VM's and
    the Mac's CPU. `--features ""` uses the flags files `omacvm apply` wrote;
    the real screen goes through the portal with a test picker.
  - `tests/video/webrtc-summary.py RESULT.json...`: runs side by side, CPU per
    frame and per megapixel (frames counted at each sender's last size).
